# Kickstarter_challenge
 ## Overview of Project
 The purpose of this project was to better understand why Louis's play was able to generate more money in a shorter amount of time compare to other plays in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 
### Purpose
 In order to visualize this, we will need to analyze the campaign outcomes based on their lunch dates and funding goals and will be broken down in 2 parts. For the first part, we will use our knowledge of pivot tables and graphings to visualize the campaign outcomes. For the second part, we will need to visualize the outcomes based on goals and we do this using percentages. 
## Analysis and Challenges
   ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For the first part of the assignment, I created a pivot chart from the data set. I then edited the PivotTable Fields to reflect the information that we are looking for. I filtered for Parent Category and Years, I placed outcomes in columns and values, and added date created conversion to the rows section. From there, I compared my results with the challenge and they were accurate. I then created a line chart and changed the title of it so that the data was easier to read. It is important to note that I did not run into any challenges with retrieving the correct data, placing it into the correct fields, or not having the correct data chart. 

   ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For the second part of the assignment, I added the appropriate column headings to a new sheet and began working on my countifs formula which I did run into errors with. I had to contant 2 Learning Assistants both of which stated that they are not sure why my data doesn't compare with that in the module especially since the function and inputs I used in the formulas appeared to be correct. I do feel that there may be discrepencies in the data which is why it is not reflecting the correct output. I was told by the Learning Assistants to just reenter the formulas again because they did not know that the issue was and or that it is "normal" to have that many zeros. However, I did compare my work again the Kickstarter sheet and there should not have been so many zeros and I also tried reentering the formulas that still did not seem to resolve the issues. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    - 1) The "theaters" category was far more successful than failed or canceled. In fact, it was 60% more successful. 
    - 2) The "theaters" category had the lowest engagement in the month of December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    -As with any dataset, I believe that the biggest limitation is that there may be discripencies in the data itself. I used the correct formulas but was still not pulling in the correct data. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - We can create box whisker plots using the ranges that we created for the Outcomes Based on Goals Section and we could also use a scatter plot to better visualize the outcomes against the years.
